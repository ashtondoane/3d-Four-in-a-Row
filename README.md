# 3d-Four-in-a-Row

This was a project that both my friend Naoto and I made seperate bots for.

In a game called 3D Four in a Row, we created bots to choose the best move for the next turn based on a minimax algorithm.

# Rules
The game is set on a 4x4x4 grid, and you simply drop in your color of sphere each time it is your turn, similar to four in a row. The first person to achieve four spheres in a row wins. 

# Game Theory
There isn't much concrete theory on this game, but there are certain spaces that can clearly be shown to be better than others in certain cases, as well as having multiple in a row could be viewd as good.
